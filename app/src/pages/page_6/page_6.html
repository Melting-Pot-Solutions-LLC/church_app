      <p class="normal">Thank you for downloading the Personal Liturgy app by Midtown Fellowship. This app is designed to complement the Personal Liturgy series that will run from January to May 2018, and will be live starting on January 21st.</p>
    <p class="normal">This series is the fruit of a long-running discussion amongst our pastors about what it means to live a healthy and vibrant Christian life in America today. Apathy, distraction, self-reliance, cynicism and self-absorption run rampant in our culture and steal the spiritual joy that is available to us in Christ. So we want to take five months&mdash;120 days&mdash;to fight those things with everything we have.</p>
    <p class="normal">Each day of this series will have a unique journal entry paired with a church-wide challenge. We will do these daily challenges together, in order to cultivate spiritual health and walk in the abundant, Godward, others-centered life God has called us to in Scripture. The progress bar at the top of your screen will keep up with your progress every time you click &ldquo;Save&rdquo; for a day&rsquo;s entry.</p>
    <p class="normal">So come back on January 21st for the first challenge, and every day after that. Let&rsquo;s do this, together, for the sake of our souls and for the health of our churches.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, you can find out more about this series and explore other resources at PersonalLiturgy.com.</p>
